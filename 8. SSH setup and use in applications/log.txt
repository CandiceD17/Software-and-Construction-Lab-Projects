First, set up the beaglebone to connect it with my computer by following the step on piazza.

1. Log in to the Beaglebone
$ sudo ssh root@192.168.7.2
Update database:
~# sudo apt-get update
~# sudo apt-get install xauth
~# sudo apt-get install xvfb
~# sudo apt-get install firefox-esr-l10n-en-gb 


2. Connect to the Wifi
Following the instruction on piazza:
~# connmanctl
connmanctl> enable wifi
connmanctl> scan wifi
connmanctl> services
Note down the identifier for CR3760-wifi:
wifi_2cf7f10678bc_4352333736302d77696669_managed_psk
connmanctl> agent on
Using the identifier we saved, connect to CR3760:
connmanctl> connect wifi_2cf7f10678bc_4352333736302d77696669_managed_psk
Passphrase? 3760ClassNet
connmanctl> quit
And my beaglebone is successfully connected to CR3760.


3. Create a new user for my partner in Beaglebone
My partner's name is Mingyang Zhang, and his uid is 405170429
Create his user name in the directory /home/Mario:
~# sudo useradd -d /home/Mario -m Mario

Then, create his password:
~# sudo passwd Mario
I generated his password as 0624.

After this, create a directory .ssh under my directory:
~# cd /home/Mario
/home/Mario# sudo mkdir .ssh

Then, transfer the ownership of this directory to my partner:
/home/Mario# sudo chown -R Mario .ssh

Use chmod 700 to give him permission to read, write and execute:
/home/Mario# sudo chmod 700 .ssh

Finally, use the command ifconfig to generate my address for my partner
/home/Mario# ifconfig
My inet addr under the wlan0 is 10.97.85.85
And my partner does the same thing for me.


4. Log in to my partner's beaglebone
Generate private and public keys using:
$ ssh-keygen
And type enter for passphrase (empty passphrase).

Then, the output tells me that my identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa. And my public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

My partner runs ifconfig on his terminal, and generates his inet address 10.97.85.86
Then, push the public key to his server:
/home/Candice# ssh-copy-id -i Rui@10.97.85.86
And enter my password:1117
And my public key has been saved to his server.

Then, I add my private key to ssh-agent:
/home/Candice# eval `ssh-agent`
/home/Candice# ssh-agent

Finally, I can log in to my partner's server:
/home/Candice# ssh -X Rui@10.97.85.86
$ xeyes
And I get a graphical window on my display.
I could also run other commands on his server, for example:
$ mkdir test
$ ls
test
Then I can find my newly-created directory test.
