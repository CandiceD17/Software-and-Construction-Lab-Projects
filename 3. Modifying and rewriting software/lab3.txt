Hunk #1 succeeded at 1900 (offset -3 lines).
The pnum is number of directory needed to be ignored when finding the file to be patched. Since the patch is "--- a/src/ls.c +++ b/src/ls.c", we just need to ignore a or b to search for src in the current directory. So use -p1.
$ make
//rebuild the patched ls.c
//The make command recursively checks all the file in the subdirectories and decide whether they need to be recompiled again. It seems to update ls.o under src and update its man page.

$ cd src
$ ./ls -a -A
//Now that the ls command with -A at the end does not output any . and .. This indicates that the bug is fixed
$ ./ls -a
//The output still contains . and ..
$ ./ls -A -a
// The output still contains . and .. This means that the -a command at the end overrides -A.
$ cd ~//coreutilsInstall/bin
$ ./ls -a -A
//The output still contains . and .. The bug in this unmodified version is not fixed by the patch.
